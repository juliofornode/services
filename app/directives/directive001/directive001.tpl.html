    <div class="panel-body">

        <p>There are three main kinds of AngularJS directives:</p>

        <ul>

            <li ng-repeat="type in types"> <b>{{ type.name }}</b> - {{ type.description }} </li>

        </ul>


        <br>
        <br>
        <p><b>Other important notes:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>We can use the priority attribute to set the order in which several
                directives will run. Careful, if two directives have the same priority
                level, that will cause an error.</li>

            <li>We can use the controllerAs attribute and the controllerBind when we
                want to substitute more than one scope.</li>

            <li>We can use pre-link and post-link functions (just putting the
                link function into an object with the property "pre" or "post") to
                set the order in which the link functions of several directives
                will be run.</li>

            <li>We can use the require attribute to require the controller of
                another directive. We will need to use ^ if the controller is in a directive
                placed in a separate DOM element (or node) and ^^ if the controller
                is in a parent DOM element. We can require more than one controller
                by using an array. </li>

            <li>We can use services to extract the logic of our directive's controller.</li>

            <li>If we add dependency to the $q service, we can use promises in our custom service. Using
            a promise allows us to set what to do if the promise fails.</li>

        </ul>
