        <p>To avoid problems with minification, we must annotate the service dependencies as strings in an array that includes the
            callback function.</p>

        <p><b>Important: </b>If the callback function is an anonymous function, the ending array bracket must be
            placed at the end of the function.</p>

        <p><b>Important (2): </b>Remember to annotate also the app.config() and anywhere else
        where you are injecting services.</p>
