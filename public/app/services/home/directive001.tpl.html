        <p>There five ways to create Services in AngularJS:</p>

        <ul>

            <li ng-repeat="type in types"> <b>{{ type.name }}</b> - {{ type.description }} </li>

        <p><b>Other important notes:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Services are designed to be injected in the other components of your application. Therefore, their
            creation is very much a part of Angular's dependency injection system. Objects that know how to create
            injectable services are called providers. In order to create a service, we must first create the provider
            that will build it with the built-in service $provider.</li>

            <li>The basic process to create a service: $provide creates the provider, and the provider creates the service.</li>

        </ul>
